                            <P>Puri is renowned for the Shri Jagannath Temple and its Golden Beach. It is one of the
                                four sacred Dhams in India, alongside Dwarika, Badrinath, and Rameswar. The temple,
                                built in the 12th century by King Ananta Varman Chodaganga Deva, features impressive
                                Kalinga architecture and stands 65 meters tall.
                                The deities worshipped here are Mahaprabhu Shri Jagannath, his sister Devi Subhadra, and
                                elder brother Mahaprabhu Shri Balabhadra, seated on the Bejeweled Pedestal (Ratna
                                Simhassana). Puri hosts numerous festivals, including Snana Yatra, Netrotsava, and the
                                famous Rath Yatra (Car Festival), which attracts large crowds.
                                Puri Beach, also known as the Golden Beach, is famous for its clean, sandy shores and
                                scenic views. It’s ideal for sunbathing, swimming, and surfing. The beach hosts the

                                cleanliness. Local vendors offer delicious seafood and coconut water
                            </P>
                            <h4>• KONARK</h4>
                            <p>The Sun Temple at Konârak, located on India’s eastern shores, is a 13th-century
                                architectural marvel. It exemplifies Kalingan temple architecture and is designed as a
                                chariot for the Sun God, Surya, with twelve pairs of wheels and seven horses. The
                                temple’s intricate carvings depict contemporary life and symbolize the cycle of seasons
                                and months.
                                The temple complex includes several distinct structures, such as the vimana (principal
                                sanctuary), jahamogana (audience hall), and natmandir (dance hall). Built under King
                                Narasimha Deva I, it reflects the strength and stability of the Ganga Empire and
                                provides insights into the religious, political, and social life of that era. The temple
                                is also linked to Brahmanism and tantric practices, embodying the personification of the
                                Sun God as described in Vedic texts.
                                The Konark Sun Temple, partially restored by British-era conservation efforts, was
                                declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984. It remains a major Hindu pilgrimage site,
                                especially during the Chandrabhaga Mela in February.
                                <br>

                                up to Satpara on the eastern bank. Chilika is the largest brackish water lagoon on
                                India’s east coast, rich in biodiversity. It serves as the largest wintering ground for
                                migratory waterfowl in the Indian subcontinent and hosts over 800 species, including
                                rare and endangered ones like the Barakudia limbless skink. Designated as India’s first
                                Ramsar Site, it includes Nalaban Island, a bird sanctuary.
                                The lagoon supports over 0.15 million fisherfolk and varies in size from 1165 to 900
                                sq.km between monsoon and summer. A 32 km channel connects it to the Bay of Bengal near

                                archaeological, historical, and religious significance. Located on two adjacent hills,
                                these caves date back to the 2nd century BCE and were primarily carved as residential
                                blocks for Jain monks during King Kharavela’s reign.
                                Khandagiri has 15. Notable caves include Ranigumpha, Hathi Gumpha, Ananta Gumpha,

                            <h4>• RATH YATRA</h4>
                            <p>The Ratha Yatra in Puri, Odisha, is one of the oldest and largest Hindu chariot
                                festivals. Celebrated annually in June or July, it involves the deities Jagannath,
                                Balabhadra, and Subhadra being taken out of the Jagannath Temple in massive, decorated
                                chariots. The deities are transported to the Gundicha Temple, where they stay for a week
                                before returning to the Jagannath Temple. The festival symbolizes the journey of the
                                deities to their aunt’s home and is attended by millions of devotees.
                                The three chariots in Puri’s annual Ratha Yatra festival are:
                                Nandighosa: Lord Jagannath’s chariot, the largest with 16 wheels, red and yellow
                                clothing, and charioteer Daruka.
                                Taladhwaja: Lord Balabhadra’s chariot with 14 wheels, red and green clothing, and
                                charioteer Matali.
                                Darpadalana: Goddess Subhadra’s chariot with 12 wheels, red and black clothing, and
                                charioteer Arjun.
                                The chariots, resembling Rekha duel-style temples, are distinguished by size, color, and
                                wheels, and are rebuilt annually except for the Kalasa.
                            </p>
                            <H4>• NUA KHAI</H4>
                            <img src="odisha_food.jpg" aligne="center" alt="Paris" style="width:50%;">
                            <p>Nuakhai Juhar Festival is a festival where the new harvest is worshipped.
                                People come together and offer the first rice of the harvest to their deities before
                                consuming it with their families. This newly harvested rice is referred to as ‘Nabanha.’
                                Nuakhai is believed to have nine colours.
                                As such, nine sets of rituals are conducted before the main celebration.
                                These nine colours represent different aspects, including cleanliness, invitation,
                                searching for the new harvest, gifting, etc.
                                Nuakhai also represents a new beginning for many.
                                It is time to leave behind your grievances and start anew. Gifts are shared amongst
                                loved ones, and blessings are sought from the elders.
                                The festival ends with people putting on many dances, dramas, and folk songs expressing
                                their tradition and culture. All have fun and merriment.
                            </p>
